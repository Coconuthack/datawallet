    "- A blockchain-based data-exchange that allows users to earn a passive income from their data\n",
    "- Users get rewarded either via the proprietary network token (DXT) or via personalized services\n",
    "- It gives users complete ownership over their own data, while giving developers and data consumers access to a marketplace for high-quality data. \n",
    "- Data consumers use data exchange tokens (DXT) to purchase data directly from creators using a smart contract which ensures security and transparency from both parties. \n",
    "- It also provides a data API to enables developers to use this data to build apps.\n",

    "- 90% of the world's data has been generated in the past 2 years. Thats a lot of data! We need a new business model\n",
    "- Data generated through your use of social media and other online platforms are currently controlled by those companies\n",
    "- DataWallet lets you share data as you wish and earn money from it.\n",
    "- A Datawallet profile gives you data mobility, allowing you to easily plug into any AI-powered app and get personalized services.\n",
    "- It allows you to trade anonymized parts of your data to businesses or developers who list contract offers. \n",
    "- Contracts specify the type of data it will collect and the benefit offered, namely Datawallet’s data exchange token DXT. Datawallet will provide payout options\n",
    "- User data production is fragmented across different platforms, Data Brokers must employ probabilistic models to approximate the likelihood of data points belonging to a given user. These highly fallible models lead to misunderstanding of target audiences.\n",

    "- Market Research- It allows for entirely automated data capture which eradicates the biases associated with traditional surveying techniques. \n",
    "- Deterministic Advertising-  Advertisers can deterministically find the right target customers based on verifiable historic as well as real-time social media and purchase data. \n",
    "- Personalized Car Insurance - A user’s collated data wallet is exactly what Auto insurers are looking for\n",
    "- Personalized Loan Underwriting - lenders are always searching for ways to more accurately determine a borrower’s probability of defaulting.\n",
    "- Psychographic Hiring - A digitally interpretable collation of an applicant’s experiences, talents, and personality (their data)\n",
